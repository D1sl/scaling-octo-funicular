console.log("Hello");
// Pseudocoding

// Time blocks are created and appended on the page

// When a block is clicked, it turns into an input element

// When user clicks out of that block or clicks the save icon, the event is saved

// A loop that checks each time block once every second to see if it is in the past, present or future and changes its color accordingly
